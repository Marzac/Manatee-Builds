Manatee firmware is a complex and large clock work construct involving many modules and user settable options.  
Despite all the efforts involved to provide our customers with a the highest software quality possible, use cases and setups for this machine are endless and every situation could not be tested.  
Therefore we are grateful for any bug report submitted by our customers: it will result in improving the instrument experience & usability for every one.
